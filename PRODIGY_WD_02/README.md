# Stopwatch Web Application

A simple and functional stopwatch web application built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.  
The app allows users to start, pause, reset the timer, and record lap times with precise time tracking.

## Features

- Start, pause, and reset stopwatch
- Displays time in hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds
- Lap time recording
- Real-time UI updates
- Responsive and clean user interface
- Keyboard- and click-driven interactions

## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (setInterval, DOM manipulation, event listeners)

## Project Structure

├── index.html
├── style.css
└── script.js

## How It Works

- Uses `setInterval()` for real-time time calculation
- Time state is updated and rendered dynamically
- Lap times are stored and displayed in the DOM
- Reset clears both timer and lap records

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/shanmugapriya3426/PRODIGY_WD_02.git

2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser

## Learning Outcomes

- Understanding JavaScript timers
- DOM manipulation and event handling
- Managing application state without frameworks
- Structuring a small frontend project
